I am an experienced Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the computer software industry. I have experience in virtual reality and game development with Unreal Engine and Unity3D, iOS development with Objective-C and Swift, the Flutter framework for mobile, and web backend development with TypeScript, AWS, GCP, and Firebase.

In my spare time I work on a custom 3D game engine written in the Nim programming language, while integrating and working with tools and frameworks written in C++ and the Vulkan API. I also enjoy contributing to various open source projects, and dabbling in creative writing.

My current favourite tools are Flutter for mobile apps, TypeScript and AWS for backend, and Nim for rapid prototyping and custom solutions.

In the future I would like to learn the Rust programming language to dive into its community and growing ecosystem.
