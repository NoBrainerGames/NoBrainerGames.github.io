Today might just be the start of my next adventure.

Several things happened that made me feel like the next chapter of my life had arrived. The whole day I was feeling a blooming wanderlust in my chest, the kind I felt when I started my first startup 12 years ago.

I submitted my letter of resignation at 9am sharp today. This last role was a career-defining one -- I have made such good friendships and invaluable connections over the last two years. The close bonds and the no-BS, can-do attitudes that I have found here are exactly the things that I hope to find in every professional environment that I end up in. But today my hunger for more knowledge, bigger challenges, and larger unknowns has once again engulfed me.

At 8:30am sharp today, I applied for a business name. No Brainer Games is officially official! And it cost me a whopping $44 to keep it for a year. I don't know what I'll end up doing with that name, but I want to do something with it. I need to.

I woke up today at 6:30am sharp with a fire in my chest. Like the good kind -- the kind that makes people think and do crazy (good) things. I think I have an idea for my next adventure. And I think it is a good one.

P.S. I also totally got emailed rejection notices for job applications by three different companies within 5 minutes of each other. The fire was blown to the side a little (are my skills that mediocre?), but I think it'll keep burning for a bit still.
