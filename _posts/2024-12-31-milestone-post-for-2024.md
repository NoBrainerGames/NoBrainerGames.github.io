The year 2020 put a nagging question in my head: *what is a difficult problem that I can enjoy working on, one that could possibly become my life's work?* 6 months later I had come up with a vague problem statement: *make a game engine uniquely suited for creating VR action RPG games.*

I had some experience creating VR games using Unity3D and Unreal Engine 4 in past jobs, and really enjoyed the creative, technical, and grant writing (ðŸ™ƒ) aspects of it, but I was never exposed to the lower level systems running behind the scenes.

So I embarked on a journey of coffee-fuelled nights and socially-deprived weekends towards what seemed like an impossible goal at the time. 4 years and 3 rewrites later, I am proud to announce the demo of my upcoming indie game made with my own game engine!

I laid out the following requirements for the engine MVP:
1. Must be written in a small programming language that I can contribute to.
2. Said programming language must be able to interface with both C and C++.
3. 3D rendering system must be portable to all major desktop and mobile platforms without too much extra work.
4. Physics, rendering and animation systems must be fast with many rendered objects.
5. Architecture must be modular and components easily testable.

I'm happy to say that the MVP has (mostly) hit these requirements, having the following notable features:
1. Written almost entirely in the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) programming language -- including the shaders -- with some C and C++ for glue code for third party libraries.
2. Uses [Diligent](https://diligentgraphics.github.io/) with the Vulkan API, taking advantage of bindless resources, indirect rendering, and instancing to render arbitrary scenes in 1 draw call.
3. GPU-driven animation of skeletal meshes loaded from gltf2 asset files for efficient crowd animation.
4. Force-based rigid body physics based on particles implemented with compute shaders, supporting >98k simultaneous collisions at 120+ FPS on an Apple M2 Pro machine.
5. Custom ECS that supports usage across DLL boundaries, used for hot code reloading and plug-in functionality.
6. Nim to HLSL transpiler with shader reflection, enabling rapid prototyping and unit tests that are run on CPU. Try out the (very) WIP [playground](https://nobrainergames.com/playground.html) to see the transpiler working.

 There are quite a few missing elements that need to be implemented to get the demo to a playable state. For instance there is still no sound subsystem, although my partner [Anna del Rosario](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annadelro) who is a talented music producer decided to have some fun with it by adding sound post-recording. Another missing piece is lighting which is currently in development.

While there is still a metric ton of research, development and QA to be done, I would love to get in touch with Nim/XR/graphics/game devs and founders out there to learn and share ideas. Check out my [blog](https://nobrainergames.com/) for more details on the project and contact information. I am in the process of opensourcing parts of the code in my [github account](https://github.com/n0bra1n3r) and will be looking forward to feedback on it, so feel free to follow/watch!

By the way, I used [meshy.ai](https://www.meshy.ai/) to create the demo assets which saved me an unimaginable amount time and cognitive bandwidth.
